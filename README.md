# DSO-670-Coding-Project

This repository contains code that explores numerical experiments from the paper "The Power and Limits of Predictive Approaches to Observational-Data-Drive Optimization" by Dimitris Bertsimas and Nathan Kallus. In paritcular, we will explore the performance of the predictive and prescriptive parametric methods outlined in the paper on synthetically generated demand data.

The "Sanity Check" file contains three matlab files. predParam(n) computes the revenue generated by the predictive approach found in Section 6 of the paper given n data points. presParam(n) computes the revenue generated by the prescriptive approach described in Section 5 of the paper given n data points. The sanity check script replicates Figure 4(a) in the paper for the predictive and prescriptive parametric approaches to ensure that the code for both methods works correctly. 

The "Experiment 1" File contains three matlab files. predParam(n,c) computes the revenue generated by the predictive approach given n data points and coefficient c that determines the true relationship between historical prices Z and contextual data X (i.e. Z=cX+W). presParam(n,c) does this for the prescriptive parametric method. The exp1 script plots the revenue for the predictive and prescriptive methods for varying choices of c.
